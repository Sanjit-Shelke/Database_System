                Constraining the Values of your data.

--1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations 
--   of cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are excluded from the date field.
ANS:-
  create table orders
 (
  onum int(4),
  cnum int(4),
  snum int(4),
  odate date NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (ONUM,CNUM,SNUM)
 );

-- 2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted,
-- snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).

ANS:-
  CREATE TABLE SALESPEOPLE
 (
  snum int(4) PRIMARY KEY,
  sname varchar(10)  CHECK (SUBSTR(UPPER(SNAME),1,1) BETWEEN 'A' AND 'M'),
  city varchar(10),
  comm float(3,2) DEFAULT 0.10
 );


-- 3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, 
-- and the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields
ANS:-
   CREATE TABLE ORDERS
 (
  onum int(4) NOT NULL,
  Cnum int(4) NOT NULL,
  snum int(4) NOT NULL,
  CHECK(ONUM > CNUM AND CNUM > SNUM)
 );
